## Musical Room Ambience Monitor

M-RAM, Musical Room Ambience Monitor, is designed to provide generative ambient music and sounds for a user’s bedroom. The project was inspired by the concept behind Brian Eno’s  pioneering album, ‘Ambient 1: Music for Airports”, where he played with the idea that an indoor space should have a soundtrack that is suited to it. He felt that indoor environments should have music that "induce calm and a space to think" while remaining "as ignorable as it is interesting". 

From this idea we thought it would be interesting to create a system that is suited to a bedroom. So for example, at night we play a very soft chord on a pad with the sound of rain to provide a calming feeling while the user tries to sleep. And then in the morning wake them with a gentle slow melody before during the day transitioning to a more stimulating fast paced piece. 

M-RAM uses the time of day, ambient light and motion to alter the sound and music that is played. It is primarily based in SuperCollider and also uses Arduino for data acquisition and Processing for GUI.
