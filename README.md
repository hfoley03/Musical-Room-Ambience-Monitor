## Musical Room Ambience Monitor

M-RAM, Musical Room Ambience Monitor, is designed to provide generative ambient music and sounds to a user’s indoor space. Inspired by Brian Eno’s sentiment that it is a waste to spend years designing a space and then put no thought into what music is played in it. 

M-RAM uses the time of day, the ambient light in a room and motion to alter the sound and music played in a room. It is primarily based in SuperCollider and also uses Arduino for data acquisition and Processing for GUI.
